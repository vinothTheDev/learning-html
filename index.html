    <p>NANCY DREW, an attractive girl of eighteen, was driving home along a country road in her new dark-blue convertible. she had just delivered some legal papers for her father.</p>
    <p>It was sweet of dad to give me this car for my brithday," she throught. "and it's fun to help him in his work."</p>
    <p>Her father, Carson Drew, a well-known lawyer in their home town of river height,frequently  discussed puzzing aspects of cases with his blond blue-eyed daughter.</p>
    <p>Smiling, Nancy said to herself,"Dad depends on my intuition." </p>
    <p>An instant later she gasped in horror. From the lawn of a house just ahead of her a little girl about five years of age had darted into the roadway. A van, turning out of the driveway of the house, was barelu fifty feet away from her. As the driver vigorously sounded the horn in warning, the child became confused and ran directly in frot of the van. Miraulously, the little girl managed to cross the road safely and pull herself up onto a low wall, which formed one side of a bridge. But the next second, as the van sped away the child lost her balance and toppled off the wall out of sight!</p>
